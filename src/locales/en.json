Information is stored in a decentralized way, eliminating the need for a central authority to manage it and ensuring immutability of data. Furthermore, the use of a decentralized website distributed over a network of nodes (computers belonging to the network) makes the system more secure and reliable than traditional websites hosted on centralized servers. These are thus able to provide a higher level of security and privacy, since the data is not subject to the risks of traditional websites. This is what really makes the difference and makes the initiative unique compared to all the others already existing and traditional verification methods."
